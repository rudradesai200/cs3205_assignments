### Assignment 3 : OSPF Routing Algorithm

#### Commands to run

- `make`

#### Makefile Explanation

##### Clean

- Cleans all the prebuilt directories and programs
- `rm -rf files graphs`

##### init

- Initializes various directories for logs and outputs.
- `mkdir files files/inputs/ files/outputs/ files/logs`
- `g++ graph_generator.cpp -o graphs`

##### run

- First, we generate random graphs using `graph_generator.cpp`

  - `g++ graph_generator.cpp -o graphs`
  - `./graphs`

- Then, to simulate the main algorithm, we use `runner.py` script, which simulates running multiple routers together

  - `python runner.py -h` : Provides the help window
  - `python runner.py -n 8 -f files/inputs/infile1.txt -o files/outputs/output1 -t 11 > files/logs/log1.txt` : This will run the main algorithm on `files/inputs/infile1.txt` (generated by `./graphs`), and the logs will be visible in `files/logs/log1.txt` and the outputs files will be in `files/outputs/output1`

- To view the logs properly (with colors)

  - `cat files/logs/log1.txt`
